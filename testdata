Section 1: What is Cloud Computing

1. I have some private servers on my premises, also I have distributed some of
my workload on the public cloud, what is this architecture called?
A. Virtual Private Network
B. Private Cloud
C. Virtual Private Cloud
D. Hybrid Cloud
Answer D.
Explanation: This type of architecture would be a hybrid cloud. Why? Because we are
using both, the public cloud, and your on premises servers i.e the private cloud. To
make this hybrid architecture easy to use, wouldnâ€™t it be better if your private and public
cloud were all on the same network(virtually). This is established by including your
public cloud servers in a virtual private cloud, and connecting this virtual cloud with your
on premise servers using a VPN(Virtual Private Network).

Section 2: Amazon EC2

2. What does the following command do with respect to the Amazon EC2 security
groups?
ec2-create-group CreateSecurityGroup
A. Groups the user created security groups into a new group for easy access.
B. Creates a new security group for use with your account.
C. Creates a new group inside the security group.
D. Creates a new rule inside the security group.
Answer B.
Explanation: A Security group is just like a firewall, it controls the traffic in and out of
your instance. In AWS terms, the inbound and outbound traffic. The command
mentioned is pretty straight forward, it says create security group, and does the same.
Moving along, once your security group is created, you can add different rules in it. For
example, you have an RDS instance, to access it, you have to add the public IP
address of the machine from which you want access the instance in its security group
